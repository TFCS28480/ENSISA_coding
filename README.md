This repository contains my work to sharpen my knowledges in different coding languages.
It represents a part of the research I've made to deepened my understanding of some concepts learned during my engineering course.

I've got some Linux basics knowledges on VM that I can't show on this repository.
I'll do my best to upload more, so stay tuned !
